    `node node_modules/nodemon/bin/nodemon index.js`
    to install globally `npm install -g nodemon`

5. add formidable module for parsing form data, especially file uploads (https://www.npmjs.com/package/formidable)
    `npm install formidable --save`

6. add express.js http://expressjs.com/ in new folder named here (SampleExpress) for sample test

7. install express globally with express generator

8. create a new app `myApp` with the cmd `express create myApp`

# MEAN.JS (format modules: http://meanjs.org/ and https://github.com/meanjs/mean)
------------------------------------------------------

    * Open-Source Full-Stack Solution For MEAN Applications

# What is MEAN.JS?

    * MEAN.JS is a full-stack JavaScript solution that helps you build fast, robust, and maintainable production web applications using MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js.

# Why MEAN.JS?

    * MEAN.JS will help you getting started and avoid useless grunt work and common pitfalls, while keeping your application organized. Our goal is to create and maintain a simple and readable open-source solution that you can use and trust in your projects.

# Getting started

    * After downloading the source code go over the official documentation of MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and Node.js, then continue with the MEAN.JS Documentation.

# The Friendly & Fun Javascript Fullstack for your next web application (http://mean.io/ and http://learn.mean.io/)

# Express
    * Express is a minimal and flexible node.js web application framework, providing a robust set of features for building single and multi-page, and hybrid web applications.

# AngularJS
    * AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.

# Node.js
    * Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications.

# MEAN STACK
------------------------------------------------------

    * MEAN is a framework for an easy starting point with MongoDB, Node.js, Express, and AngularJS based applications. It is designed to give you a quick and organized way to start developing MEAN based web apps with useful modules like Mongoose and Passport pre-bundled and configured. We mainly try to take care of the connection points between existing popular frameworks and solve common integration problems.
