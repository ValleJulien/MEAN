    + Open-Source Full-Stack Solution For MEAN Applications

# What is MEAN.JS?

    + MEAN.JS is a full-stack JavaScript solution that helps you build fast, robust, and maintainable production web applications using MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js.

# Why MEAN.JS?

    + MEAN.JS will help you getting started and avoid useless grunt work and common pitfalls, while keeping your application organized. Our goal is to create and maintain a simple and readable open-source solution that you can use and trust in your projects.

# Getting started

    + After downloading the source code go over the official documentation of MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and Node.js, then continue with the MEAN.JS Documentation.

# MEAN STACK
------------------------------------------------------

    + MEAN is a framework for an easy starting point with MongoDB, Node.js, Express, and AngularJS based applications. It is designed to give you a quick and organized way to start developing MEAN based web apps with useful modules like Mongoose and Passport pre-bundled and configured. We mainly try to take care of the connection points between existing popular frameworks and solve common integration problems.
